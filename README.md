# Lab Logging Script

Script to log hours within the SPU Banner System.

Written in Python and using Mechanize.


To use, either clone my repo or copy paste the script into your own python script.

Then, change the <SPU_USERNAME> field and <SPU_PASSWORD> field with your information.
Look at the update time sheet function and follow my instructions (comments) to populate the correct information based on your own shift times.


run the script and it will automatically log your hours -- with the one assumption that you are running the script the DAY OF your shift.
